## Introduction

Movie recommendation systems play a crucial role in providing users with personalized movie suggestions. This project utilizes content-based filtering techniques to recommend movies similar to those a user has shown interest in. By analyzing textual features of movies, it suggests relevant recommendations tailored to the user's preferences.

## Data Acquisition

The movie dataset is obtained from a CSV file containing various attributes such as genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director, and more. This dataset serves as the foundation for building the recommendation system.

## Data Preprocessing

Prior to model building, the dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values. Null values in selected features are replaced with empty strings to ensure data consistency and integrity.

## Feature Engineering

To capture the essence of each movie, the selected textual features are combined into a single feature called 'combined_features'. This consolidated feature provides a comprehensive representation of the textual attributes of each movie, facilitating effective model training.

## Model Training

The textual data is transformed into feature vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. Cosine similarity is then computed between the feature vectors to quantify the similarity between movies. This similarity metric serves as the basis for generating movie recommendations.

## Movie Recommendation

Given a user's favorite movie, the recommendation system identifies similar movies based on content similarity. It suggests a list of movies that closely match the user's preferences, facilitating personalized movie recommendations tailored to individual tastes.
